    "In order to generate new silk squares, like those designed by Hermès, we will need data, preferably in the form of photos, of the models created by the fashion house. After a little research on the web, we find different sources of data. There are blogs of brand enthusiasts, listing images of squares from various collections. On the Hermès website you can find very good quality images of the latest collections. We will therefore try, first of all, to extract from these different sources what will be the raw material to provide to our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of extracting data from websites is called data scraping or web scraping. The legal framework for this practice is a bit of a gray area. You must always be careful not to violate the terms of use of the applications or website on which you want to retrieve this data. In addition, this practice sometimes consists of generating multiple requests that may affect the proper functioning of the site or application in question. It is therefore a question of knowing what one does not to be outside the law.\n"

    "<p>One way to do this would be to use a program that controls our browser to scroll and load the different items automatically. Unfortunately (or not) the site is quite good at detecting this kind of program and will not let us do so.</p>\n",
    "<p>Therefore, we are going to see what is happening in the back kitchen of the site. We want to try to understand the requests sent to the server when, as a user of the site, we scroll to load more items. To do this we will use a tool called mitmproxy. This is a software positioned between our computer and the web server to which we address ourselves when we visit the site, and which will collect the requests that we send to the site, as well as the responses provided by the server hosting the site.</p>\n",
